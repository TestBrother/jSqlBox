=====================TODO List======================
* DB type query (can convert to List, Map, Array, Set)
example: user.loadList(Email.class)  or user.loadList(Email.class, "order by id");
loadList method is based on DB query method, so need think about query method carefully.

* L1 Cache (similar but not exact as Hibernate's L1 cache, does not cache save/update/delete command, only cache entities)

* L2 cache (use Hibernate's Ecache,  or Redis)

* nullable, insertable, updatable need implemented in Box's insert update methods

* .cacheLoad()  .cacheQuery()  forceInsert(), forceUpdate()  method to used L2 Cache 

* .cacheCompare() to check if database has been changed.

* .cacheClear() to clear L2 cache

* .BatchCacheSave   .BatchCacheUpdate()   .BatchCacheExecute to Entity batch operate (similar like jdbc batch methods)
  
* Blob, Clob type?(or just use JDBCTemplate)

* add MS SQL SERVER 

* Divided or config to 2 different type, one support container PO manager, another not, but both support 1st, 2nd cache.

* For exception, delete class name, add error code, do not directly show entity in error message
