jSQLBox is a micro scale database access tool, simpler than Hibernate but more powerful and simplier than JDBC/JDBCTemplate/MyBatis/DButils.  
#(jSQLBox project is in pending, currently only have concept design)  

Other persistence tools' problem:
Hibernate: It's ORM tool, too complicated, the XML or Annotation configurations are fixed, fields definations, "One to Many", "Many to One" relationships are fixed, hard to create/modify configuations at runtime.  
Other tools: Have no a balance between powerfulness and simpliness. 

Feature of jSQLBox:  
1) Simple, very few source code, No XML, easy to learn and use.   
2) The Java-Based Bean configuration can be created/modified dynamically at runtime(similar like jBeanBox project).  
3) The configuration and Bean classes can be created by source code generation tool because it's a simple map of database tables, it's a database driven toolï¼Œdesign database first, then config it 2nd.
4) jSQLBox is based on Active Record mode.  
5) There is no "many to one", "One to Many", "Cascade update" concept in jSQLBox, need load and maintence beans by hand. 
6) jSQLBox support transparent persistence based on a transaction scope bean cache (supported by AOP tool like jBeanBox)
7) jSQLBox offers basic CURD methods, but encourage mixed use with raw SQL, it's safe to mix use CRUD methods and sql, jSQLBox do not re-invent SQL language, only do a simple pack of SQL to let it can work with bean cache. 
8) Current version jSQLBox only support MySQL, in future version will support most databases(depends on how many contrubutors.)
9) To make it simple (The more time you learn = the harder to maintenance), jSQLBox project only focus on basic CRUD method + SQL + transparent persistence, do not offer complex functions like paginnation, lazy load.

A basic introduction of how to use jSQLBox:
---
Example 1 - Basic configuration and CRUD & Transparent Persistence
```
public static class Order extends SQLBox{//Can automatically created by code generation tool
   String orderID;  
   String orderNO;  
   String customerID;  
   //getters & setters...
   { setDBTable("Order");   //if DB table name same as class name, no need write this line
     setDBField(orderID,"DBOrderID");//If DB column name same as field name, no need write this line
   }
}

public static class Customer extends SQLBox{// Can automatically created by code generation tool
   String customerID; 
   String customerName;  
   Integer totalOrderCounts;
   //getters & setters...
} 

public class Tester {
    public void insertOrder(String customerID){
      Order order=new Order(); 
      //".putInCache()" can omit if SQLBox.setBeanCache(true) be called, default is true
      order.setCustomerID(customerID).putInCache(); 
      
      //customer also be cached, as I said, default setBeanCache is true
      Customer customer=Customer.loadbyID(customerID);
      
      /* Below code use a raw sql, jSQLBox does not re-invent SQL language but support cache beans' 
       * dirty-checking to impliment transparent persistence, it's based on a threadlocal variable works on 
       * background, and it also do some other complex jobs like change it to PreparedStatement to prevent 
       * SQL injection, all above functions are benefited from ActiveRecord design architecture.
       * ORDER() is a static imported method to tell SQLBox the table name.
       */
      customer.setOrderCounts('select count(*)+1 from "+ORDER()+" where "+ORDER.OrderID()
                   +" = "+ order.getID()));
      
      //below line = SQLBox.defaultContext.flushCache();
      SQLBox.flushCache(); //All beans in cache, if be modified will be saved, 
      //There is no need explicitly call flushCache method, it can be configured in AOP like transation.
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Tester t=new Tester();
        t.insertOrder("001");
    }
} 
```
In above example, a default global singleton defaultContext be used, similar concept can see jBeanBox project example#3, this defaultContext included datasource setting, if in a project used multipule datasource, need use context's methods instead of directly use SQLBox's (default global context) static methods.
 
Example 2 - Bean configuration reuse
```
 public static class Customer2 extends Customer{ 
   String newAddress;
   //getters & setters...
   {setDBField(newAddress,"New_Address");   //address1 map to database field "db_address1" 
    setDBField(customerName, Null);//Set Null means customerName will not be fetched in SQL.
  }
} 

 public static class Customer3 extends Customer{ 
   { setOnlyKeep(customerID);    
     setOnlyKeep(newAddress); //only "customerID" and "newAddress" are kept, other fields are not visible
  }
} 
```
Now Customer2.class has a new field "newAddress" map to database field New_Address, Customer2.class can be created dynamically in services layer, it's a child class of Customer, and in loadByID method, it will fetch New_Address from DB but no longer fetch customerName. And Customer3 only keep customerID and newAddress fields, other fields are disappeared.

Example 3 - This example shows how to use jBeanBox and jSQLBOx to achieve "Declarative Transaction". This example integrated "C3P0" + "jSQLBox" + "Spring Declarative Transaction Service" but replace Spring's IOC/AOP core with jBeanBox, more detail of jBeanBox project can see https://github.com/drinkjava2/jBeanBox.
```
public class TesterBox extends BeanBox {
    static {
        BeanBox.defaultBeanBoxContext.setAOPAround("examples.example3_transaction.Test\\w*", "insert\\w*",
                new TxInterceptorBox(), "invoke");
    }

    static class DSPoolBeanBox extends BeanBox {
        {
            setClassOrValue(ComboPooledDataSource.class);
            setProperty("jdbcUrl", "jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/test?user=root&password=yourpwd");
            setProperty("driverClass", "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
            setProperty("maxPoolSize", 10);
            setProperty("CheckoutTimeout", 2000);
        }
    }

    static class TxManagerBox extends BeanBox {
        {
            setClassOrValue(DataSourceTransactionManager.class);
            setProperty("dataSource", DSPoolBeanBox.class);
        }
    }

    static class TxInterceptorBox extends BeanBox {// Advice
        {
            Properties props = new Properties();
            props.put("insert*", "PROPAGATION_REQUIRED");
            setConstructor(TransactionInterceptor.class, TxManagerBox.class, props);
        }
    }

    public static class SQLBoxBox extends BeanBox {
        {
            setConstructor(SQLBox.class, DSPoolBeanBox.class);// to think it, not finish
        }
    }
}

public class Tester { 

    public void insertUser() {
        SQLBox.execute("insert into "+USERS()+" values ('"+VAL("User1")+"')");
        // int i = 1 / 0; // Throw a runtime Exception to roll back transaction
        SQLBox.execute("insert into users values ('User2')");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Tester tester = BeanBox.getBean(Tester.class);
        tester.insertUser();
    }
}
```
